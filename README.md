## Prevent conflicts!
If you already have another active AdBlock, I suggest you to disable it at least for the YouTube website. This will prevent both from conflicting and will allow my extension to offer you the best user experience!

## Additional features
- Ads between Shorts will be automatically skipped
- Some buttons are disabled to limit bugs and unperformable actions*

<br>

## Known issues
- It's not possible to make clips*
- Tab selection is disabled ( WIP )
- Player may forget the current playing time and restart the video
- Player does not have the same function keys as the default one, but I've replicated the [main keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/JoSimon05/YT-AdBlock_by_Jo/edit/Latest/README.md#keyboard-shortcuts-for-youtube-player)
- Sometimes pages may be a bit laggy

For any other problem or bug, please report them in [Issues](https://github.com/JoSimon05/YT-AdBlock_by_Jo/issues) section.
