## Let's prevent conflicts!
If you already have another active AdBlock, I suggest you to disable it at least for the YouTube website. This will prevent both from conflicting and will allow my extension to offer you the best user experience!

## Keyboard Shortcuts for YouTube player
> For security reasons, you need to move the focus away from the video player to use keyboard shortcuts.

- Space / K &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; play/pause
- M &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; mute/unmute
- C &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; toggle subtitles
- F &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; toggle fullscreen
- Arrow Up &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; volume up (+5)
- Arrow Down &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; volume down (-5)
- Arrow Right / L &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; forward (+5s)
- Arrow Left / J &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; backward (-5s)
- Shift + N &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; next video
- Shift + P &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; previous video
- *(WIP) &nbsp; 0 - 9 / Num 0 - Num 9 &nbsp; &#10230; &nbsp; jump to 0% - 90%*

<br>

## Known issues
- Ads between Shorts won't be hidden (but they can easily be skipped)
- Video playback may stop when switching to Miniplayer mode (by pressing "i").
- Player does not have the same function keys as the default one, but I've replicated the [main keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/JoSimon05/YT-AdBlock_by_Jo/edit/Latest/README.md#keyboard-shortcuts-for-youtube-player)

> For any other problem or bug, please report them in [Issues](https://github.com/JoSimon05/YT-AdBlock_by_Jo/issues) section.
