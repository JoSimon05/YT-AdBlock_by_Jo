## Let's prevent conflicts!
If you already have another active AdBlock, I suggest you to disable it at least for the YouTube website. This will prevent both from conflicting and will allow my extension to offer you the best user experience!

## Keyboard Shortcuts for YouTube player
> For security reasons, you need to move the focus away from the video player to use keyboard shortcuts

## Known issues
- Ads in between Shorts won't be hidden (but they can easily be skipped)
- Video playback may stop when switching to Miniplayer mode (by pressing "i").
- video player does not have the same function keys as the default one, but I've replicated the [main keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/JoSimon05/YT-AdBlock_by_Jo/edit/Latest/README.md#keyboard-shortcuts-for-youtube-player)
